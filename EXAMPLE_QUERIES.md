## 💡 Tips for Better Queries

### ✅ Good Query Examples
- "How many help tickets are pending by all users, give names"
- "Show me all active workflows with their current steps"
- "List users in IT department with their pending ticket count"

### ❌ Avoid These
- Vague queries: "Show me stuff"
- Too complex: "Show me everything about everything"
- Ambiguous: "What's happening?"

### 🎯 Best Practices
1. **Be specific**: Mention table/entity names (tickets, workflows, users)
2. **Include filters**: Status, date ranges, departments
3. **Request details**: "give names", "with details", "show counts"
4. **Use natural language**: Write as you would ask a colleague
